<h1 align = 'center'> A study of <b>Crime rate</b> in Maringá PR</h1>

<p align = 'center'>
  This is a study i made in my city about the influences of investment in Sports in Crime rate / 100mil habitants. In this study i used pandas and seaborn but at some points i could have used matplotlib too.
  I wanted to prove that when the government invests in sports we can have a decrease in crime rate, obviusly not only because of that, but it influences. To prove that, i searched for number of "bolsas", investment in sports and crime rate over the years, and the data i could find was:

<p align = 'center' > We conclude from this two plots that as investments increased, the number of "Bolsas" also increases and the "Crime rate" decreased, that means that more people sought to obtain the athlete scholarship and the criminality at Maringá decreased </p> 


<p align = 'center' > This next image is a plot of the 3 variables we were studying over the years, and we can say that once the Investments were growing, the search for athlete scholarship were growing too, and at the same time the crime rate suffered a decrease, it is concluding that this 3 variables are linked. </p>
